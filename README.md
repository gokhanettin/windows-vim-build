# WINDOWS VIM BUILD

**NOTE:** INSTRUCTIONS IN THIS REPO MIGHT FAIL. I DO NOT MAINTAIN THEM ANY MORE.
BECAUSE I CURRENTLY USE [SPACEMACS] ON GNU/LINUX EXTENSIVELY. I KEEP THIS REPO
FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.
 
These are my personal notes and some occasional scripts to automate my work.

## Vim

Under vim directory, you can find some instructions and scripts for the
following tasks.

- How to compile Vim on Windows
- How to compile clang on Windows
- How to compile YouCompleteMe on Windows, and an example .ycm_extra_conf.py is
  also provided and it shows how to add necessary paths to the configuration.

Note that I am using x86-64 Windows 7. Instructions might fail to work properly
on other platforms.
